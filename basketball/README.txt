This directory contains a variety of programs related to NBA players.

The full_stats.py file will scrape data from basketball.realgm.com to create a csv file with every player's stats
who played between 1970 and 2017. This file is saved as mvp_totals as it also saves a column indicating whether 
the player that season won mvp.

The mvp_logistic_regression.py file will run an algorithm that runs a logistic regression on any player's season
to see the chance that they won mvp that season.

The rest of the files are mostly just helper files that perform various functions.
